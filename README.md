# DDoS-Research
My Personal Research On Known DDoS Attacks, Using BPF

# Getting Started 

I have these attack captures thanks to [scaredos](https://github.com/scaredos). They can be found at [ddos.studio](http://www.ddos.studio/pkts)

I'll be going over what stood out to me. Lets first begin to talk about common DDoS, as most of you know; DDoS can be really annoying, and some attacks can be really hard to break down. This is the main reason I am doing this today, to help the community against more-advanced floods. If you want direct contact just add me on Discord, or follow my instagram. I try my best to stay active on these platforms \\ discord = spencer'#1044 | [instagram](https://instagram.com/vucixc). Now, let's get started!
