# random-tcp-flags.pcap

This is a pretty simple attack, but I'll put it in here. As the title says, it uses random TCP flags in each attack; such as ACK, RST, PSH. It contains mainly malformed packets with a length of 0, I also saw some ECN, CWR; but no SYN. I will not classify this attack as a TCP Reflection. I noticed this attack puts strain on the conntrack module, just like a TCP Reflection. I came up with a simple patch using the conversation packets involved, I then looked at the hex-decimal output and came up with a BPF application using netfilters. I matched the byte starting at the IP header offset, after that; I implemented the hex output to the IP header offset syntax. I set no packet-length value to this as it was a consistent ZERO!
